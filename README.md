 ## *Description*
 ### This is my submission for week 19's Progressive Web Application (PWA) Challenge: Budget Tracker.

 ### A very simple budget tracking app the keeps track of your current balance with the ability to enter financial transactions as they occur. The app graphically displays your balance over time.  
 
 - ### The app utilizes a service worker to allow for offline servicing of files.  
 
 - ### It also uses IndexedDB for data storage of transactions allowing for offline functionality.
 
 - ### Finally, the app is a progresseive web app that allows the app to be downloaded and run from outside the stardard browser environment.
  
 ### Application may be accessed either in my GitHub Repository or deployed live.
